CarPool! built with the idea of busy mothers needing to shuffle children is a platform for car users to share seats with non-drivers. Using the Google Maps API, drivers can input start and end destinations, arrival time and date, and available seats, which then get saved as a route. Riders are shown seats available on a route when they input their data.  After a driver and a rider are matched, the Twilio API connects users so that drivers and riders can confirm the arrangement and provide details. Built with busy mothers in mind, the app is useful in other contexts including: getting to a particular venue for an event; carpooling to public transportation stations; or getting a ride home from a university on holidays.
