*CarPool!* built with the idea of busy mothers needing to shuffle children is a platform for car users to share seats with non-drivers. Using the Google Maps API, drivers can input start and end destinations, arrival time and date, and available seats, which then get saved as a route. Riders are shown seats available on a route when they input their data.  After a driver and a rider are matched, a message is sent using the Twilio SMS messaging service to connect users so that drivers and riders can confirm the arrangement and provide details. The app was built with busy mothers in mind and could be utilized in many different contexts. 

To run the app PostgreSQL must be installed on your machine. I used these two links to install PostgreSQL.
